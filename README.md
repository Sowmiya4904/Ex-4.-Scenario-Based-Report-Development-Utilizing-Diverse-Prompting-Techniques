# Ex-4.-Scenario-Based-Report-Development-Utilizing-Diverse-Prompting-Techniques
Objective: The goal of this experiment is to design and develop an AI-powered chatbot that can handle customer inquiries, provide support, and improve customer experience in a retail environment. Create prompts using various AI prompting techniques to guide your experiment, data collection, analysis, and report creation.
## Aim: 
To design and develop an AI-powered chatbot for retail that can effectively handle customer inquiries, provide product and order support, and enhance customer experience. The experiment will explore different prompting techniques (zero-shot, few-shot, role-based, chain-of-thought, and self-consistency) to evaluate the chatbot’s accuracy, efficiency, and customer satisfaction.
## Algorithm: 
Problem Definition

Define chatbot objectives: answering FAQs, order tracking, product recommendations, return/exchange support, etc.

Identify success metrics: response accuracy, customer satisfaction, resolution time.

Dataset Preparation

Collect sample customer queries (product search, order status, complaints, etc.).

Create training/testing datasets with diverse query patterns.

Prompt Design (Using AI Prompting Techniques)

Zero-shot prompting: Direct query without examples.

Few-shot prompting: Provide example Q&A pairs before the test query.

Role-based prompting: Instruct AI to act as a “Retail Support Agent.”

Chain-of-thought prompting: Ask AI to reason step-by-step before answering.

Self-consistency prompting: Generate multiple reasoning paths and pick the most consistent answer.

Model Execution

Deploy prompts to the AI model (e.g., GPT).

Record chatbot responses for each technique.

Performance Evaluation

Measure accuracy of responses.

Evaluate clarity, helpfulness, and relevance of answers.

Collect simulated customer satisfaction scores.

Analysis

Compare results across prompting techniques.

Identify which method works best for different types of queries (e.g., zero-shot for FAQs, chain-of-thought for complex troubleshooting).

Report Generation

Document methodology, results, and analysis.

Summarize chatbot performance and provide recommendations for real-world retail deployment.
## Prompt:
Design and develop an AI-powered chatbot for a retail environment that can handle customer inquiries, provide product and order support, and improve customer experience. Collect sample queries, train the chatbot using zero-shot, few-shot, role-based, chain-of-thought, and self-consistency prompting techniques, analyze its accuracy and customer satisfaction, and finally generate a structured report summarizing the experiment.
